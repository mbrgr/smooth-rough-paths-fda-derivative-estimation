# Smooth and Rough Paths in Mean Derivative Estimation for Functional Data
  
  Max Berger, Hajo Holzmann
  [arXiv:2503.24066](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24066)

##Overview

The paper investigates the estimation of partial derivatives of the mean function in multivariate functional data analysis. It derives near-optimal convergence rates in the minimax sense under a fixed synchronous design over HÃ¶lder smoothness classes. 
The study emphasizes the supremum norm due to its relevance in visualizing estimation errors and constructing uniform confidence bands. A key finding is that the smoothness of the process paths significantly influences the rates of convergence:

  - Smooth Paths: If the process paths exhibit higher-order smoothness than the derivative order, the parametric $\sqrt{n}$ rate is achievable under a sufficiently dense design.

  - Rough Paths: For processes with lower-order smoothness, convergence rates are necessarily slower, and the paper determines a near-optimal rate at which estimation remains feasible.

The paper proposes a method to evaluate the smoothness of sample paths by comparing restricted estimates of the partial derivatives of the covariance kernel. 
Therefore the R-Package [biLocPol](https://github.com/mbrgr/biLocPol) (still in work) can be used, which can be installed via:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mbrgr/biLocPol")
# library(biLocPol)
```
